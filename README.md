# pydebug
a small set of python sketches that do not run as expected and wait to be
debugged.

used as exercises for

![power.coders](powercoders-cropped.png "power.coders")

the idea of these buggy sketches is to learn to read python's traceback. python
will tell you very precisely why and also where it is unhappy with your code.
one of the goals of these snippets is to learn to read the traceback and then
fix the code.


good luck!
